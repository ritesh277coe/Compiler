# Compiler<br/>

**Basic compiler theory**.<br/>
<br/>
G = (V, T, P, S) where G = grammar, v = variable, T = terminal, P = production, and S = start symbol<br/>
<br/>
Ex: E => E+E | E\*E | id ..Letâ€™s derive id+id+id   (assume input as 2+3+4)<br/>
LISP representation 1:	ADD((2) (ADD ((3) (4))))<br/>
LISP representation 2:	ADD((ADD ((2)(3))) (4))<br/>
<br/>
Above grammar is ambiguous as it has 2 AST for same expression. The problem with grammar that it is not aware of ASSOCIATIVITY RULES of '+'. + is left associative because it needs left most expression to evaluate first.<br/>
From above, representation 2 is correct.<br/>
<br/>
Let try id\*id+id. (assume input 2\*3+4)<br/>
LISP representation 1:	MUL((id) (ADD ((3) (4))))<br/>
LISP representation 2:  ADD((MUL ((2) (3))) (4))<br/>
Above grammar is ambiguous  as it has 2 AST for same expression. The problem with the grammar is that is not aware of PRECEDENCE RULES OF OPERATOR. <br/>
As we know that '\*' has higher precedence then '+', '\*' needs to be evaluated first. Hence representation 2 is right.<br/>
<br/>
Another example of ambiguous  grammar:<br/>

```
Ex1	S => aS|Sa|a  input = aa, since 2 parse trees, hence grammar is ambiguous 
	S -> (aS) -> (a(a)) 1st parse tree
	S -> (Sa) -> ((a)a) 2nd parse tree
	
Ex2	S -> aSbS | bSaS | e   input ab, Grammar is not ambiguous  for input ab
	S -> aSbS -> aebS -> aebe
	
	input = abab, so 2 parse tree and grammar is ambiguous 
	S -> aSbS -> aebS -> aeb(aSbS) -> aeb(aebS) -> aebaebe = abab
	S -> a(bSaS)bS -> a(beaS)bS -> a(beae)bS -> abeaebe = abab
```

**Few definitions:**<br/>
<br/>
What is Left associativity or Right associativity?
Dictates how the expression should be evaluated i.e whether left side should be evaluated first (Left recursive grammar = A=Aa) or right side should be evaluated first (right recursive grammar A=aA).<br/>
For ex: a+b+c can be (a+b)+c or a+(b+c). But right way is left associative as it should be evaluated ((a+b)+c). Similarly (((a+b)+c)+d)
Same for a\*b\*c, a-b-c.<br/>
<br/>
But how about 2^3^4, This expression has to be evaluated with right associativity, as 3^4 should be evaluated first and then (2^(3^4)).<br/>
NOTE: Since aS|Sa means that it can be left/right associative at same level, that makes it ambiguous  grammar.<br/>
<br/>
What is Precedence of operation?<br/>
For example: a+b\*c (From https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence, and https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11precedence/) '\*' has higher precedence than '+'). <br/>
The right evaluation tree is a+(b\*c).<br/>
<br/>
So how we write grammar that can help us work with **ASSOCIATIVITY RULES and PRECEDENCE RULES OF OPERATOR**.<br/>
<br/>
**RULES OF THUMB:**<br/>
<br/>
	1) Use of left/right recursion decides the associativity as it helps to determine whether LHS is processed first or RHS is processed first.<br/>
	2) Writing production in a manner that they are further away from Root production controls the precedence. Furthest from root would be first to get evaluated.<br/>

How to convert ambiguous  grammars into non ambiguous :<br/>
E = E\*E/E+E/id. <br/>
<br/>
**What we infer from the grammar just by looking at it:**<br/>
<br/>
E+E is ambiguous  and '+' has no associativity preference. It can be treated as left or right associative.<br/>
E\*E is ambiguous  and '\*' has no associativity preference. It can be treated as left or right associative.<br/>
'\*' and '+' have same precedence as they both are at same level. <br/>
<br/>
Lets try to convert it into unambiguous :<br/>
<br/>
Since '+', '-', '\*', '/' are left associative, the production needs to be of form E=E+T<br/>
Since '\*', '/' are of higher precedence then '+', '-',  '\*', '/'  should be far from root as compared to '+', '-'.<br/>
<br/>
See below how ambiguous  grammar (E => E+E | E\*E | id) has been converted into unambiguous  grammar.<br/>
EADD	E=E+F | F<br/>
EMIN	F=F-G | G<br/>
EMUL	G=G\*H | H<br/>
EDIV	H=H/J | J<br/>
EINT	J=id<br/>
<br/>
5\*6/3+4-5<br/>
The parser tree of this grammar will always be: EADD ((EMUL ((EINT 5) (EDIV ((EINT 6) (EINT 3))))) (EMIN (EINT 4) (EINT 5)))<br/>
Above productions E+T and T\*F are left recursive as E=E+F, and F=F-G.<br/>
<br/>
**Compilers cannot work with Left recursive grammar.** <br/>
<br/>
Left recursive grammar has the form A = Aa;<br/>
Implementation for the above grammar will be of the form:<br/>
```
A()
{
A();
a();
}
```
<br/>
Its evident that above implementation is recursive, but it is NOT checking any condition before calling itself. This behavior can cause stack overflow.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Right recursive grammar looks like, A = aA;<br/>
The implementation of right recursion is of the form:<br/>

```
A()
{
a();
A();
}
```
<br/>
And the above function can call condition checks before calling itself, This is the right way of implementing recursive functions.<br/>

From the above, its evident, left recursive grammar are bad, as they can go in infinite recursion.
